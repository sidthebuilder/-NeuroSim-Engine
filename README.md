# Abandoned Life Simulation AI Prototype

This is the (incomplete) character model for an abandoned life simulation game, planned to be similar 
to The Sims, Paralives, InZOI, or Life By You.  It was abandoned due to the conclusion that this kind 
of game is just too big for me to make by my self.  That, and decided wanted to do other things with 
my life than constantly work on this.  Besides, one of my core motivations, complaints about current 
Sims (TS4) game, weren't as bad as I at first thought.

The core data model had working six core traits (dimension / slider type, shared by all), 
talents (similar to RPG ability scores), emotions, and skills.  Not started were minor 
traits (more specific characteristics, of which up to six would be selectable), likes/dislikes/interests,
and goals & desires (of which perhaps three could be picked).  An early prototypes of a deciscion making 
AI was started, but never finished.

In addition to the game it was being developed for (a "dollhouse life simulator"), it had been hoped that 
some aspects might be usable in other contexts, notably lifely NPC AIs in RPGs.  (Note, that the prototype 
was abandoned before anything that lifely like was achieved in decision making.)

This was not intended to be released under any liscense, but you may use it under the MIT liscense, it you 
choose.  This is likely only useful with either further developed or to canibalize for specific subsystems.
