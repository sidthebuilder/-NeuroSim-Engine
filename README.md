# 🧠 NeuroSim Engine: AI-Driven Character Behavior System

> A futuristic AI character simulation engine built for lifelike decisions, emotions, and dynamic behavior modeling — redesigned and reimagined by [Shashank](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/shashankk51).

---

## 🚀 Overview

NeuroSim Engine is a modular AI-based system designed to simulate human-like decisions and emotional intelligence for games, research tools, or simulation environments. Inspired by the original "CharacterEngine" project, this version is actively developed, extended, and maintained to reflect cutting-edge practices in simulation logic and AI character modeling.

🧠 Vision
“By 2030, every NPC should feel human.”
NeuroSim aims to bridge emotion, cognition, and decision-making — all in one unified simulation layer.
